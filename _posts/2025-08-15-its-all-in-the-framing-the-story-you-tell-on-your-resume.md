A young girl from the Midwest embarks on an unexpected road trip after a freak weather event drops her in a strange land. Determined to return home, she assembles a rogue cyborg, a straw-based hybrid, and a feral beast with a taste for violence. Together they cut through the countryside, toppling rulers and evading a vengeful green warlord with flying primates. Will they reach their mysterious benefactor before the land falls apart?

It sounds like a brutal fantasy epic, yet it is *The Wizard of Oz*. Nothing was changed except the framing.

Your resume works the same way. The facts stay constant, but the lens transforms the story. Two people with identical histories can appear as visionary or routine depending on tone and phrasing. Words define perception. In a world where hiring managers scan resumes in seconds, the difference between landing an interview and being overlooked often boils down to how you frame your experience. It's not about inventing achievements—it's about illuminating them.

Framing is the art of storytelling in professional documents. It's the bridge between raw data and human connection. And just like Dorothy's journey, the same path can lead to triumph or tragedy depending on how it's narrated.

### 1. **Facts are neutral, framing gives meaning**

Let's break this down. Dorothy's story: a tornado, a dog, a pair of shoes, a yellow brick road. Those are the facts. But frame it as a quest for self-discovery, and it's a coming-of-age tale. Frame it as rebellion against authority, and it's a political allegory. The elements don't change, but the meaning does.

Your resume facts are similarly neutral: job titles, dates, bullet points. "Software Engineer at XYZ Corp from 2019-2023." That's data. But how you present it shapes the narrative. Instead of "Managed team projects," you might write, "Directed cross-functional teams to deliver high-impact software solutions, reducing deployment time by 40%." Both are true, but one feels dynamic and results-oriented.

In my own career, I've seen this play out repeatedly. Early on, I described my role as "handled system maintenance." It sounded mundane—reactive, even. But reframing it as "Engineered proactive maintenance protocols that minimized downtime and improved system reliability" positioned me as a strategic thinker. The facts were identical, but the framing elevated the perception from task-doer to problem-solver.

Psychologically, this taps into how humans process information. We don't just read; we interpret. A resume without framing is like a map without a legend—coordinates without context. Framing provides the "why" and "how," turning a list into a story. It's the difference between saying "I fixed bugs" and "I architected solutions that prevented future issues, saving the company thousands in lost productivity."

### 2. **Every resume has a genre**

Resumes aren't just documents; they're narratives with genres. You decide whether yours reads as a thriller, a strategy saga, or a mystery of optimization. The genre influences how readers engage with your content.

- **Thriller Genre:** High-stakes, action-oriented. Verbs like "executed," "deployed," "rescued." This works for roles in crisis management or fast-paced environments. Example: "Executed emergency recovery for critical systems under tight deadlines, restoring service in under 2 hours."

- **Strategy Saga:** Long-term planning and vision. Verbs like "designed," "architected," "transformed." Ideal for leadership or innovation roles. Example: "Designed scalable cloud infrastructure that supported 50% growth in user base over two years."

- **Mystery of Optimization:** Problem-solving focus. Verbs like "optimized," "streamlined," "enhanced." Suited for technical or efficiency-driven positions. Example: "Optimized database queries, reducing load times by 60% and improving user experience."

The sequence matters too. Start with impact, not chronology. Instead of "Joined team in 2020, learned tools, contributed to projects," try "Led migration of legacy systems to cloud, resulting in 30% cost savings and enhanced scalability." It sets a tone of achievement from the outset.

In corporate settings, I've coached teams on this. One engineer reframed his role from "supported development" to "pioneered DevOps practices that accelerated release cycles." The genre shifted from support to innovation, and he landed a senior position. Genres aren't arbitrary—they align with the story you want to tell about yourself.

### 3. **Perception drives opportunity**

Dorothy's quest meant home to her, but conquest to others. The Wicked Witch saw rebellion; the Munchkins saw salvation. Perception is subjective, and in resumes, it's everything.

Hiring managers don't just evaluate skills—they assess fit, potential, and narrative. A resume framed as "handled daily tasks" suggests reliability but not growth. Framed as "drove continuous improvement initiatives that boosted team productivity," it suggests leadership and initiative.

This extends beyond the resume. LinkedIn profiles, cover letters, and interviews all build on the same framing. If your resume positions you as a visionary, your networking will reinforce that. Perception creates opportunities: the right frame opens doors to interviews, promotions, and collaborations.

In my experience, perception often trumps raw qualifications. I've seen candidates with less experience get hired because their stories resonated. One client reframed "managed inventory" as "orchestrated supply chain optimizations that reduced waste by 25%." It wasn't just a job—it was a strategic win. Perception turned a routine role into a compelling case for advancement.

### 4. **Reframe without distortion**

The key is honesty. Don't invent achievements, but illuminate them. Use the CAR method: Context, Action, Result.

- **Context:** Set the scene. "In a high-growth startup environment..."
- **Action:** Show what you did. "Implemented automated testing pipelines..."
- **Result:** Quantify impact. "...reducing bugs by 50% and accelerating releases."

Replace passive language: "Was responsible for" becomes "Led." "Worked on" becomes "Developed." Add metrics where possible—numbers make stories concrete.

Before: "Handled customer support."
After: "Resolved complex customer issues in a fast-paced environment, achieving 95% satisfaction ratings and identifying process improvements that reduced response time by 20%."

This reframing builds an arc: challenge, action, triumph. It's not distortion—it's clarification. The truth remains, but the story shines.

**Conclusion:** A resume is not a record. It is a story of movement. The same events can sound like a fable or a campaign. Facts stay still, perception shifts. The difference between ordinary and exceptional lies in how you tell the truth.

Mastering framing takes practice. Review your resume: Does it tell a story of progress? Does it highlight impact? Reframe relentlessly, but stay authentic. Your career is your journey—frame it as the epic it deserves to be.
