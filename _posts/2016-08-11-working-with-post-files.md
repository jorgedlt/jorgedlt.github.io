## Creating New Post files

This is super quick, I can add content by creating a new POST file, that new file must have YAML Front Matter and other other stuff.

To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md

## Updating the website structure itself

My process is still a little rocky, and as per github after August 23rd, they will support the jekull (3.2.x). But for now everything seems to be working, reasonably well.
